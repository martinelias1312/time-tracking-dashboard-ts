## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Typescript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass/Scss](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This was one of my longest challenges, i tried to do it all on my own. Mostly i struggled on sending props from one component to other. But anyways, i learned to fetch data, from local json in this case, communicate through components, little bit of typescript...

### Continued development

I´ll definitely continue to practice React to get better and to create apps with more ease.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) - This helped me to start React with node.
